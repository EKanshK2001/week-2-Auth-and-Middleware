## Mini Project to practice authentication using jwt and more middlewares

### Tech Stack (TypeScript, Express, jwt)


### Things to cover :
- Provide a jwt token encoded with some user information (provided at signup or something)
- Store the jwt token in the user's localStorage
- Send the token back in every request header that needs the auth/login (use a middleware to authenticate) 


### Run :
- npm run dev
