# Mini Project to practice authentication using jwt and more middlewares

## Tech Stack 🚀
### Backend -> TypeScript, Express, jwt, 
### Database -> MongoDB, 
### Frontend -> React, Recoil

#

## Tests Done:
- working signup feature
- working signin feature
    - store the access token from the request in the localStorage
    - use it in every pages request header

- authenticated user allowed on surf across protected pages (with and without persisted state)

- display current user's data on profile page/all pages
    - you can introduce recoil here to store the user's data globally

- make multiple new users and surf from their acc with their data


#

### Things covered :
- Provide a jwt token encoded with some user information (provided at signup or something) ✅
- Send the token back in every request header that needs the auth/login (use a middleware to authenticate) ✅

#

- Bring in mongodb, use that to actually store user data at signup and sign it in the jwt along with username ✅
- and when on signin, fetch user data from the id after decoding the jwt ✅

#

- Introduce React to test all the routes with a frontend ✅
- Send backend requests with axios ✅
- Implement the logic to store the access token in the localStorage and use it in subsequent requests ✅
- Display the user data recieved after login on the profile page (closing browser and no signin) ✅

- as for storing the user data after login, we can do that in a global state manager like recoil ✅

#

### Run :
- npm run dev
