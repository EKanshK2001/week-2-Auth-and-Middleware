## Mini Project to practice authentication using jwt and more middlewares

### Tech Stack (TypeScript, Express, React, jwt)


### Things to cover :
- Provide a jwt token encoded with some user information (provided at signup or something) ✅
- Send the token back in every request header that needs the auth/login (use a middleware to authenticate) ✅

#

- Bring in mongodb, use that to actually store user data at signup and sign it in the jwt along with username ✅
- and when on signin, fetch user data from the id after decoding the jwt ✅

#

- Introduce React to test all the routes with a frontend ✅
- Send backend requests with axios ✅
- Implement the logic to store the access token in the localStorage and use it in subsequent requests
- Display the user data recieved after login on the profile page (closing browser and no signin)

- as for storing the user data after login, we can do that in a global state manager like recoil(?)



### Run :
- npm run dev
